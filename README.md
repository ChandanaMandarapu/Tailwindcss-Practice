# Tailwindcss-Practice
This repo contains all my learnings of tailwindcss

Hello Everyone,

Tailwindcss is a popular CSS Framework. In this repo I used all my learnings of tailwind in the form of code learned all concepts from basic to advanced.

Running your Tailwindcss in nodejs i.e TailwindCLI is important

Their are many special features in tailwind and two of them are pre-defined classes for each and every property of css either it is colors or it is animations and another feature is we can define our custom styling within the tailwind enivronment that makes tailwindcss unique from all other frameworks
